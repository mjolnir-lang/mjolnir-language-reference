# Intermediate Representations

Most concepts and data structures require some form of intermetiate or native
representation while being processed or generated. There should be as little
redundancy as possible between similar contexts.

The closer to native representation of values and data strucutres the better.

Make sure high level representation is useful and processable in every
meaningful way.

Representation should be grouped by purpose (images, text, data, code, audio,
video, etc.).

The goal is to provide a common data layer for processing within an application.
