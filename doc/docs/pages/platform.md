There are 3 levels of platform.

- Architecture - The ISA and design of the machine code itself
- CPU - The implementation and features of the processing environment (single vs multiple cores)
- Board - As many boards or microcontroller contexts as are required to provide hardware and peripherals

## Hardware Initialization

- Program Loading
- Memory Regions
- Clocks
- Power Domains
- Pin Multiplexing
- Interrupts
- System Interconnects
- DMA
- Security and Encryption
- Reset Detect
- Startup Procedure
- Program memory initialization
- Timer and RTC
